This repo contains official implementations of our series of work in large-scale scene reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting, Star ‚≠ê us if you like it!
- [CityGaussianV2: Efficient and Geometrically Accurate Reconstruction for Large-Scale Scenes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00771)
- [CityGaussian: Real-time High-quality Large-Scale Scene Rendering with Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01133) (ECCV 2024)

The links above points to the papers. The main branch now has been rebased to [Gaussian Lightning v0.10.1](https://github.com/yzslab/gaussian-splatting-lightning). Feel free to explore the repository!

## üëè Features
* CityGaussian-style multi-gpu Gaussian Splatting training with controllable memory cost and no limit on GPU amount
* Analysis of model partition and data assignment
* Floater removement and 2DGS-style mesh extraction
* Large-scale scene geometric performance evaluation
* Trajectory aligned rendering & mesh video generation
* Features of [Gaussian Lightning](https://github.com/yzslab/gaussian-splatting-lightning), including web viewer, MipSplatting, AbsGS, StopThePop, etc.
